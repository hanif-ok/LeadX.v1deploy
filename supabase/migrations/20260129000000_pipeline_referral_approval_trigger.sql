COMMENT ON FUNCTION handle_referral_approval() IS
'Handles pipeline referral approval by:
1. Reassigning customer to receiver RM
2. Reassigning all open pipelines to receiver with referred_by_user_id set for 4DX tracking
3. Reassigning closed pipelines to receiver (without changing referrer)
4. Marking the referral as COMPLETED

When pipelines close as WON, the original referrer gets 4DX credit via referred_by_user_id.';
